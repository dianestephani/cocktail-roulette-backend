### About
Cocktail Roulette is an application designed to generate cocktail recipes based on the 1:1:1 formula (Ex. the Negroni, Boulevardier, etc.). Ingredients will be stored in a database (MongoDB) under 3 categories: spirit, herb, and bitter. The application will randomly select an ingredient from each category, and I will combine the selected ingredients with other syrups or bitters to create new cocktails.

### Project Status/Timeline
- May 2022: The application will print a single, random ingredient from a hard-coded array.
- June 2022 (current): Adding to the previous function to generate 2-3 random ingredients from hard-coded arrays.
- Creating a database using MongoDB to store ingredients for each category.
- Designing a simple user interface on the front end.

#### Expected To Ship: July 2022
